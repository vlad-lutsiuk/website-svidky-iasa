            <p>OUR MISSION</p>
            <h2>We exist to help creators <br> own their audience</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that social platforms are taking advantage of creators.<br>
                We want to change that and help creators fight back. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Building a career on social platforms is like building a home on someone else's <br>
                land. While social platforms are great for discovering and reaching your audience,<br>
                your goal as a creator should be to convert your followers into email or text <br>
                message subscribers. Why? Look no further than TikTok. Almost overnight, <br>
                millions of creative people almost lost their careers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If a platform removes your account, or their algorithm for distribution no longer<br>
                favours you, are you prepared? 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to build a career as a creator, your focus should be on building durable<br>
                distribution channels. Without distribution, you have no business. So how can you<br>
                build an audience that you actually own? With emails and phone numbers. These<br>
                distribution channels are direct. Instead of going through some algorithm, when<br>
                you share over email and text message, you know that your audience will see your<br>
                content. Even better is the fact that you own these lists. Instagram removes your<br>
                acount, you're ok. YouTube changes their algorithm, you're ok. You own your
                audience. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We built Marico to make this process easy, fast, and effective. The traditional<br>
                solution to this problem involves spending days building a website or hiring<br>
                someone expensive to do it for you. But those days are gone. With Marico, you<br>
                get a portfolio that is always up-to-date and converts visitors into email or text<br>
                message subscribers. The best thing? It takes under 5 minutes to setup, and it<br>
                automatically updates whenever you post new content anywhere online. We<br>
                believe the best tools are the ones you don't even notice. Marico helps you build<br>
                your own audience, without any hassle or time commitment. All you have to do is<br>
                share your portfolio link with your audience, and we'll handle the rest. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also create posts from within Marico and share them in just a few clicks<br>
                to your portfolio, and to your email and text message subscribers. Since all of your<br>
                content is already in Marico, creating content takes minutes, not hours. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For too long, social platforms have taken advantage of creators. Fight back and<br>
                build an audience that you own. 
            </p>
